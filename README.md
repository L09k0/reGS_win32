# reGS: reverse-engineered GoldSrc

This is the repository of reGS (comeback xD) source code without engine (hardware). **Based on [GoldSourceRebuild](https://github.com/Triang3l/GoldSourceRebuild) repository.**

## Current projects

- dedicated (hlds.exe) | Status: WIP (not implemented yet)
- GameUI (GameUI.dll) | Status: WIP (many bugs from Solokiller's project)
- launcher (hl.exe) | Status: Finished (also has improvements)
- particleman (particleman.dll) | Status: WIP (not implemented yet)
- tier0 (tier0.dll) | Status: Finished?
- tier1 (tier1.lib) | Status: Finished?
- vgui2 (vgui2.dll) | Status: WIP
- vgui2_controls (vgui2_controls.lib) | Status: WIP (requires re-reversing because also has many bugs from Solokiller's project)
- vgui2_surfacelib (vgui2_surfacelib.lib) | Status: Finished (by [TheDoomsayer](https://github.com/TheDoomsayer))
- vstdlib (vstdlib.lib) | Status: WIP (not implemented yet)

## Future projects

- AdminServer | GUI for HLDS
- FileSystem_Stdio | File system
- ServerBrowser | VGUI2 window with a list of all available servers
- vgui_dll | VGUI1
